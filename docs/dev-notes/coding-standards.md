# Boatnet Coding Standards


- Each file will contains 500 lines of code or less
- Generally, we will follow the Quasar and Vue.js coding standards.
  - For Quasar, review this article https://medium.com/quasar-framework/wip-look-at-the-source-code-please-1b905ea4906

- For code formatting, this is defined explicitly in our tslint configuration in the boatnet repository. E.g. https://github.com/nwfsc-fram/boatnet/blob/master/apps/obs-wcgop-optecs/tslint.json
- Whenever possible, remove all linter warnings from your code before merging into master. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the automatic Format Document (Shift-Alt-F key by default) in Visual Studio Code.
